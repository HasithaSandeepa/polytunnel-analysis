# Polytunnel Fan Placement Research – Salad Cucumber Cultivation

This project focuses on analyzing temperature and humidity variations inside a polytunnel where **Salad Cucumber** is grown.  
The aim is to provide **optimal fan placement suggestions** to improve air circulation and create a sustainable microclimate for better crop yield.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Collects **temperature and humidity data** from 15 sensors arranged in 3 sections (5 sensors per section).  
- Integrates **external weather data** such as air temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, wind, and sunlight.  
- Generates **2D heatmaps** of the polytunnel environment.  
- Uses **machine learning and correlation analysis** to suggest optimal fan placement.  
- Designed to support **sustainable farming practices** in Sri Lanka’s Low Country Wet Zone.  

---

## 🔬 Features
- Sensor-based **temperature and humidity monitoring**.  
- **Heatmap visualization** of sensor locations.  
- Data preprocessing and merging of multiple datasets (internal + external).  
- **Fan placement model** based on thermal distribution and airflow optimization.  
- Evaluates suggestions **without actual fan placement** using simulation and modeling techniques.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Deploy real-time monitoring using **ESP32/ESP-01S + DHT22 sensors**.
* Implement **Firebase or cloud storage** for live data collection.
* Use **deep learning models** for advanced airflow simulations.
* Build a **web-based dashboard** for visualization and decision-making.
